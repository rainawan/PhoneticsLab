              <Text p>
                Static palatography is a well-known traditional method of
                obtaining articulatory data. It is a low-tech, inexpensive tool
                that can be easily used in the field for phonetic description,
                both qualitative and quantitative. It records contact with one,
                sometimes two, articulatory surfaces. A palatogram is a record
                of contact on the palate. A linguogram is a record of contact by
                the tongue. Less common is the dentogram, labiogram, gingogram,
                ad lib. The basic principle is that an articulator either
                deposits dark material onto, or wipes it off of, the contacted
                surface.

                The method presented here is what is currently used here at the
                UCLA Phonetics Lab. It is a much improved process developed from
                an earlier method that had many drawbacks. The previous way of
                doing palatography involved chocolate powder dusted onto the
                surface of the palate, creating both a palatogram and linguogram
                at the same time. While the present method requires that the
                palatogram and linguogram be created separately, it is much less
                messy and creates high-contrast images that photograph well.
                Also, the absence of chocolate powder in the current method
                eliminates the possibility of increased salivation which
                decreased the contrast of the earlier palatograms.

              <Text h4>What are Palatograms?</Text>
              <Text p>
                A palatogram is an image of the region of the upper surface of
                the vocal tract contacted by the tongue due to a consonant. The
                best way to obtain such an image is to coat the tongue with a
                mixture of equal parts olive oil and activated charcoal powder
                and record the resulting transfer of pigment.
              </Text>
              <Text p className="font-semibold">
                The process is as follows:
              </Text>
              <Text p className="pb-10">
                1) To protect the subject, one should use latex type gloves and
                preferably a surgical mask. <br />
                2) Mix the olive oil and the activated charcoal powder. <br />
                3) Apply mixture to the speaker's whole tongue with a paintbrush
                or Q-Tip. NOTE: In case of dripping, one should cover the
                speaker's clothes before applying the mixture. <br />
                4) Ask the speaker to produce a word that contains the target
                sound (The word should not include any other sounds that make
                contact with the palate).
                <br />
                5) Use a mirror (preferably a sterilized inter-oral mirror), and
                place it inside the speaker's mouth at a 45Â° angle with respect
                to the plane of the teeth. See Figure 1 for more.
                <br />
                6) Use a camera or video camera to photograph the mirror's
                reflection of the place of articulation depicted by the imprint.{" "}
                <br />
                7) If a video camera is used, the image can be transferred
                directly to a computer for further processing. <br />
                8) Once the image has been recorded, have the speaker rinse out
                his/her mouth with lemonade (or lemon juice in water). See
                Figure 2 for more.

                When all the required pictures of the roof of the mouth have
                been obtained, the procedure can be reversed to produce
                linguograms, which are simply records of the areas of the tongue
                that have come in contact with the roof of the mouth.

              <Text p className="pb-10">
                1) Paint the upper surface of the mouth with the same mixture
                described in the palatography section. <br />
                2) Have the speaker produce the desired sound and observe (and
                photograph) the part of the tongue that is making the contact.
                It may be necessary to instruct the speaker to move the tongue
                up, down or to the side, to show sublaminal contact, or contact
                on the sides of the tongue. <br />
                3) Once you have finished taking the pictures, have the speaker
                rinse out their mouths with lemonade or lemon juice. See Figure
                3 & 4 for more.
                <br />
                <br />
                NOTE: Speakers' tongues differ in their absorbency to the
                charcoal mixture. For speakers whose tongues begin to collect
                black color despite repeated rinsings, it is preferable to begin
                by painting the roof of the mouth and obtaining the linguograms
                first, since repeatedly painting the tongue can cause loss of
                contrast.

              <Text h4>How to Make Alginate Impressions</Text>
              <Text p>
                Palatograms and linguograms should always be accompanied by
                diagrams showing the shape of that particular speaker's mouth in
                the form of a traditional sagittal section. Diagrams of this
                kind can be based on dental impressions of the oral cavity made
                in the field. Use chromatic dental alginate (such as Jel-Trate)
                as the impression material. Other substances which set harder
                and cannot be cut are of no use. There is no reason for these
                impressions to be made using a tray of the kind that dentists
                use, which takes an impression of the outer surfaces of the
                teeth. The outer surfaces of the teeth play no role in the
                production of speech, so they can be neglected. All that is
                needed is an impression of the inner surfaces of the teeth and
                roof of the mouth.

              <Text p className="font-semibold">
                One possible process for making impressions:
              </Text>
              <Text p className="pb-10">
                1) Mix the Jel-Trate with water in a bowl using a spatula. Don't
                use when it's still runny. You must be able to pile the mixture.
                If it runs out the sides, you won't get the whole palate and it
                could be unpleasant for the subject. <br />
                2) Heap the mixture on a mirror or other flat surface, or in an
                appropriately sized dental tray. <br />
                3) Have the subject lean forward, so that if the material does
                run out, it will not be swallowed. <br />
                4) Insert the mixture into the mouth, press up against the
                palate and teeth. You want to push up until you feel the bottom
                of the impression material to be on the plane of the teeth.{" "}
                <br />
                5) Hold in this position until set (by color change, if you are
                using color phase dental alginate, or by timing+touch). <br />
                6) Remove the tray from the person's mouth and remove the
                impression from the mirror/tray. See Figure 5 for more. <br />
                7) Trim the base of the impression so that it is flat and in
                line with the plane of the teeth. If necessary, trim the excess
                from the back and sides. See Figure 6 for more. <br />
                8) If you need to store the impression, you can wrap it in a
                wet, moist paper towel.

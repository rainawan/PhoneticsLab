              <Text p>
                Static palatography is a well-known traditional method of
                obtaining articulatory data. It is a low-tech, inexpensive tool
                that can be easily used in the field for phonetic description,
                both qualitative and quantitative. It records contact with one,
                sometimes two, articulatory surfaces. A palatogram is a record
                of contact on the palate. A linguogram is a record of contact by
                the tongue. Less common is the dentogram, labiogram, gingogram,
                ad lib. The basic principle is that an articulator either
                deposits dark material onto, or wipes it off of, the contacted
                surface.

                The method presented here is what is currently used here at the
                UCLA Phonetics Lab. It is a much improved process developed from
                an earlier method that had many drawbacks. The previous way of
                doing palatography involved chocolate powder dusted onto the
                surface of the palate, creating both a palatogram and linguogram
                at the same time. While the present method requires that the
                palatogram and linguogram be created separately, it is much less
                messy and creates high-contrast images that photograph well.
                Also, the absence of chocolate powder in the current method
                eliminates the possibility of increased salivation which
                decreased the contrast of the earlier palatograms.

              <Text p>
                A palatogram is an image of the region of the upper surface of
                the vocal tract contacted by the tongue due to a consonant. The
                best way to obtain such an image is to coat the tongue with a
                mixture of equal parts olive oil and activated charcoal powder
                and record the resulting transfer of pigment.

                The process is as follows:

              <Text p>
                1) To protect the subject, one should use latex type gloves and
                preferably a surgical mask. <br />
                2) Mix the olive oil and the activated charcoal powder. <br />
                3) Apply mixture to the speaker's whole tongue with a paintbrush
                or Q-Tip. NOTE: In case of dripping, one should cover the
                speaker's clothes before applying the mixture. <br />
                4) Ask the speaker to produce a word that contains the target
                sound (The word should not include any other sounds that make
                contact with the palate). <br />
                5) Use a mirror (preferably a sterilized inter-oral mirror), and
                place it inside the speaker's mouth at a 45Â° angle with respect
                to the plane of the teeth.
